# R3F Marble Run Game

A game made using React, Three.js and React Three Fiber, created as a part of the Three.js Journey Course by Bruno Simon.

The game consist of getting a marble from one side of a obtacle course to the other using the arrow keys or WASD-keys combined with the space bar. The obtacles are randomized and changes on every reset.

It is not responsive yet, so it only works on desktop.
